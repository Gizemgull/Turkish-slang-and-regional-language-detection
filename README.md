# Turkish-slang-and-regional-language-detection

Project Abstract
This study presents a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based application designed to detect slang and regional expressions within textual data and provide their semantic meanings along with standard language equivalents. The project is implemented using the Python programming language, where the Pandas library is utilized for data manipulation and Gradio is employed to create an interactive web-based user interface.

The dataset, prepared in Excel format, comprises a collection of slang and regional words categorized by type, meaning, and their corresponding standard forms. The system processes the user-inputted text by applying regular expression (regex) techniques—a fundamental NLP method—to identify and extract occurrences of these words. Subsequently, the detected non-standard expressions are replaced with their formal equivalents, producing a cleaned version of the text.

This project contributes to NLP studies by addressing the challenge of non-standard language detection and normalization, which is crucial for text mining, sentiment analysis, and automated content moderation systems. The tool demonstrates potential for practical use in analyzing social media content, educational materials, and regional language studies, offering insights into linguistic diversity and aiding in the standardization of digital texts.
